## Description

**Polar Panic** is a Top-Down Bullet-Hell Game where you play as a humble polar bear equipped with a polarized magnet shield, fending off waves of feisty robotic foes by attracting and repelling bullets! Collect scrap and fish pickups from the robots and make sure to keep an eye on your shield charge meter. Can you survive the bullet hell or will you succumb to the jaws of defeat?

This game was built for submission for the **December 2024 Cupertino Game Development Club's WinterMelon Game Jam**. The jam featured a 3 day development time period and the theme of "Polarity". Polar Panic **ranked 14th overall out of 233 entries to the jam**, and ranked **8th in the gameplay category**. The project was made with the Unity Game Engine and all sprites were made with Aseprite.

## Controls:

**Movement**: WASD / Arrow Keys

**Charge Shield**:
- Left Mouse: Positive
- Right Mouse: Negative

**Dodge Roll**: Left Shift
**Pause**: Escape

## Premade Asset Declaration:
- We used JSFXR for most noises aside from music.
- We used premade button outlines from a previous project for the UI with modified colors etc.
- We also repurposed an old Hitflash script for the project with minor modifications.
- We used the font "I pixel u" by rodrigosrtz on DaFont: https://www.dafont.com/i-pixel-u.font


## Known Issues:
- Scrap counter gets overwritten for each picked up scrap (top left). It was supposed to be cumulative. Already fixed for post-jam.
- Windows executable build defaults to native resolution, breaking UI for users without 16:9 displays. Already fixed for post-jam.
- Magnet charge looping sounds can stay on indefinitely.
